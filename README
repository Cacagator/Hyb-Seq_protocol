A protocol for developing probes for targeted sequence capture from an input of
genomic and transcriptomic data is contained within Building_exon_probes.sh.
This file is both a program that can be run in a Unix environment, and a
helpful document full of notes that can be read.

A workflow for analyzing the raw reads obtained from the Hyb-Seq protocol is
described in Appendix 2 (to be added).

assembled_exons_to_fastas, blat_block_analyzer, and grab_singleton_clusters are
all companion programs integrated into either the probe development or read
analysis pipelines.

Example datasets have been added: genome.fasta and transcriptome.fasta.
