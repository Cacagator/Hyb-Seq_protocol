Usage: assembled_exons_to_fastas.py -l PLSX_list -f FASTA_file -d OUT_directory [-g] [-r] [-n reference_NAME]

assembled_exons_to_fastas.py -- Processes the BLAT output from several samples
    comparing reference-guided contig assemblies with the reference (probe)
    contigs. The output is a directory containing a fasta file for each
    reference contig holding the sequence for each sample.

Input - A file containing a list of every .pslx file to be processed (one file
    per line), and a fasta file of the targeted contigs or exons. The .pslx
    files to be processed need to have been created with the targeted exons
    input as the 'database' or 'targets.'

Options:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -l CONNAME   File containing a list of the .pslx files to process; one name
               per line
  -f FANAME    Fasta file of targeted contigs
  -d DIRNAME   Name of directory for output files
  -g           Insert gaps? If the sample sequence matches the reference
               across two or more blocks, a string of Ns will be inserted
               equal to the size of the gap(s). In certain cases this may
               match the size of introns. Without this separate blocks will be
               concatenated. Default=False
  -r           Output the reference sequence as an entry in each sequence
               alignment? default=False
  -n REF_NAME  If the reference sequence is output (-r), what name will be
               given to this sample in the alignment files? Default=Reference
