Programs and documentation accompanying the paper:
Hyb-Seq: Combining target enrichment and genome skimming for plant phylogenomics
Applications in Plant Sciences 2014 2(9): 1400042.

A protocol for developing probes for targeted sequence capture from an input of
genomic and transcriptomic data is contained within Data Supplement S1:
Building_exon_probes.sh.
This file is both a program that can be run in a Unix environment, and a
helpful document with detailed notes.

A workflow for analyzing the raw reads obtained from the Hyb-Seq protocol is
described in Data Supplement S2 (to be added)

assembled_exons_to_fastas, blat_block_analyzer, and grab_singleton_clusters are
all companion programs integrated into either the probe development or read
analysis pipelines.

Example datasets have been added: genome.fasta and transcriptome.fasta.

NOTE: The latest version of CD-HIT (4.6.1) contains a bug that appears when
using the example data provided here. To successfully use the example data one
should either use a CD-HIT version prior to 4.6 or use the patched version
supplied here.
